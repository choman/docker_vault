# Notes:

## Install
- ./run.sh
- edit setup.sh
- ./setup.sh

## test...
Need instructions

## Send/Retrieve client files
- copy keys and token files to client

NOTE: Now client should be able to unseal vault using keys 
and access data using token

## Notes:
- docker-vault submodule does not appear to be needed
- dockerhub vault may be running slightly older version of vault
