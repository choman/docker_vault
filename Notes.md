# Install Notes:

- ./run.sh
- edit setup.sh
- ./setup.sh

## test...
Need instructions

## Send/Retrieve client files
- copy all to client - less root token

Now client should be able to unseal vault using keys 
and access data using token

## Notes:
- docker-vault submodule does not appear to be needed
- dockerhub vaul may be running slightly older version of vault
